# Sydney Housing Affordability After COVID

This Power BI project looks at how housing affordability in Greater Sydney changed after COVID.

The focus is not on prediction. It explains **what happened**, **when it happened**, and **how households adjusted** as prices and rents moved differently over time.

---

## What this project looks at
- How house prices reacted quickly after COVID
- Why rents increased later, not at the same time
- How rental pressure built up before becoming visible
- Where this pressure settled across Greater Sydney

---

## How the analysis is done
- Uses observed data only (no forecasts)
- Compares changes using an index (2019 = 100)
- Focuses on timing and sequence, not correlation
- Uses geography to show **where** pressure ended up, not **why**

---

## Data coverage
- Area: Greater Sydney (GCCSA)
- Levels: Market, LGA, postcode
- Period: 2018–2025  
  (Latest year uses the average of available quarters)
