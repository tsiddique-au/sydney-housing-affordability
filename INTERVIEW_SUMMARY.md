# Interview Summary – Sydney Housing Affordability After COVID

## Short overview
This project looks at how housing affordability in Greater Sydney changed after COVID, with a focus on timing and household behaviour rather than prediction.

Prices responded quickly as borrowing conditions changed. Rents increased later, as many households stayed in the rental market instead of moving into ownership. Over time, this pressure spread across locations and became more persistent.

## Why I did this project
Many housing reports mix prices and rents into one story. I wanted to separate them and show how the adjustment happened in stages, not all at once.

The aim was to explain the process clearly, without making strong causal or policy claims.

## Key choices I made
- Used an index (2019 = 100) to focus on change rather than absolute levels  
- Looked at timing and sequence instead of simple correlation  
- Treated geography as an outcome of pressure, not the cause  
- Avoided forecasting to keep the analysis grounded in observed data

**Household Adjustment**  
Explains why rental demand stayed high even after prices stabilised

**Structural Outcome**  
Summarises how differences became more persistent after COVID

## Common interview questions

**Why no forecasting?**  
The goal was explanation, not prediction. Forecasting would hide timing effects.

**Why use measures instead of columns?**  
Measures allow the same logic to work across different time periods and levels.

**What is the main insight?**  
Temporary shocks can create lasting affordability differences when household adjustment is limited.

## How this could be extended
- Add income or wage data
- Compare Sydney with other cities
- Look at longer-term post-COVID outcomes
